Doctrin API Tests use REST-Assured library to make REST calls and retrive response details and processing them. This is wrapped around with by a library and framework build in java and maven to make writing tests, building and integrating with CI/CD systems easy. Cucumber-TestNG frameworks are also used. Cucumber makes test cases easy to maintain, create, read and understand to non-technical users while testNG is used to run the cucumber feature file and also makes it easy to integrate and scale with other systems.

Note: The tests run in the background, give it time to finish and generate the report.

## Reporting

A text file report with the result of the run is created after each test run 
The text report file is located in 'TextReport' folder once the test has completed: TextReport/Result.txt

The text file also records details on the errors that may occur if the API fails to retrive data.

A Cucumber report is generated after each test run

The report is located in target folder once the test has completed: DoctrinAPITest/target/cucumber-html-report/cucumber-html-reports/overview-features.html

The overview-features.html is the report overview

The report-feature_doctrinAPI-feature.html can be accessed by clicking on the Feature name in the report overview. This shows all the test scenarios and test steps that are run as part of the test and also shows fail cases along with appropriate errors.
